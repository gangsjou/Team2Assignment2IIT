       <p>Although the image shows a USB Medical Bracelet, my idea is a watch, necklace, or brooch that can hold a useful 
        amount of medical information that can be easily accessed in case of emergency (perhaps by QR code). I believe that 
        it should also contain a GPS tracker to show the location of the person. It should be able to be accessed either by a 
        professional organisation (such as MePacs) or by the wearer's family. This would be useful for people with a variety 
        of disabilities such as dementia, non-verbal people, those with diabetes, heart disease etc. Although Apple watches have an 
        automated alert, these are very expensive and family members may not be able to access the location information.</p>
