       <h3>About CardioScan</h3>
       <p> </p>
        <p>CardioScan is a global company that collects and analyses cardiac data and reports their findings to primary health 
        practitioners. Their purpose built BeatBox Cardiac Management Platform has been built with a primary focus on security 
        and efficiency and collects data from over 5000 users globally, reporting over 1million tests a year, and with over 8000 
        devices in the field. CardioScan continually innovates to provide a technology led, cardiac reporting service. </p>
        <p> </p>
         <h3>About the role</h3>
         <p> </p> 
        This role carries responsibility for testing of new and/or existing platform features including API testing, 
        automation testing and testing of manual methods and needs the successful applicant to work using Agile methodologies.  
        It also requires the successful applicant to coach the team in working to a Quality Assurance mindset and to ensuring 
        Quality Assurance best practice is met. The Quality Assurance Test Engineer, is also responsible for delivering test 
        features and frameworks by investigating, evaluating, and specifying problems and solutions, automating testing and 
        improving and developing systems and tools needed for testing. It will also be necessary to estimate time and cost 
        of work and stay within the time and cost estimates as well as supporting and promoting the CardioScan vision.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <h3>Skills and experience</h3>
        <p> </p>
        <p>This job requires experience in Quality Assurance best practice, use of unit and regression testing tools, 
            implementation of automated test frameworks, good verbal communication skills, good problem-solving skills, 
            up-to-date knowledge of the latest testing technologies and practices and the ability to integrate these as needed.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <h3>Qualifications</h3>
        <p> </p>
        <p>A degree in computer science is still preferred by most employers. Programming skills in languages such as Java, C++, 
            JavaScript, and Python, would be an asset. Certifications that would be helpful are Certified Associate in Software 
            Testing (CAST), Certified Test Engineer (CSTE), and Certified Software Quality Analyst (CSQA).</p>
            <p> </p>
        <h3>My Qualifications Plan</h3>
        <p>I have already begun in my plan to achieve this objective by enrolling for a degree in Information Technology with RMIT 
            through OUA. I feel that having a degree will be an advantage for employability. When I have finished my degree, I will 
            then enrol in the certificates listed above which would give me qualifications in Software Testing and Quality Assurance. 
            With my education in place, I will then try to find a job and begin learning the practical skills needed to take on this 
            profession. </p>
        <h3>Why is it my dream job?</h3>
        <p>Heart disease is not only Australia's biggest killer but is also a debilitating disease that changes the lives of many 
            who suffer from it. To work with a company whose primary function is to collect, collate and share information about 
            heart disease would be very worthwhile. Working in Quality Assurance is also very important as the information will 
            mislead health professionals if it is inaccurate or incorrect. Methods of collecting, collating, and sharing information 
            must be constantly updated and improved to continue being at the cutting edge of the industry. Automated testing of the 
            software to ensure that it is working efficiently, effectively, and accurately, and ensuring that new tools, applications, 
            and methods are also working accurately, effectively, and efficiently is essential to the success of the project and of 
            the company. </p>
