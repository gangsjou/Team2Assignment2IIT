       <p>There was a teacher at my high school who began running classes in things he thought we might be interested in such 
        as mathematics, physics, and computer sciences. I think the school administration expected the initiative to fail and 
        they were amazed at how many students were prepared to give up lunch times to attend his classes. The school 
        administration closed the classes down despite their popularity stating that they felt students should spend their 
        free time outside. We were incredibly disappointed. Those classes inspired my lifelong interest in computers, computer 
        science and mathematics.  </p>

        <h3>Why study IT?</h3>

       <p>During my career in the Library and Information industry, computers very quickly became a large part of our jobs, 
        especially online catalogues, database management, cataloguing and online research skills. We also had to learn social 
        and presentation media as these became part of the skills that we needed for our own use within the industry and as 
        skills we needed to teach our students. Our catalogues and searching skills adapted quickly and easily to the online 
        environment, and we soon became adept at working in both the print based and the online environment. The students and 
        staff loved the online environment and adjusted to it very well. But it also made me want to know more about the 
        computers we were using every day and to understand more about their capabilities. I love having information available 
        to me 24/7, wherever I am and whenever I want it. I also love helping other people solve their computer problems too.
