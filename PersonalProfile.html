        <h2>Personality and other Profiles</h2>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Although qualities of successful teams tend to vary, there are some qualities that are consistently 
           held to be necessary to most successful teams. 
           These are that team members: 
            <p>   </p><p>•	have clear goals </p>
            <p>   </p><p>•	have strong leadership</p>
            <p>   </p><p>•	complete their own tasks, then help other team members </p>
            <p>   </p><p>•	communicate well</p>
            <p>   </p><p>•	resolve their conflicts</p>
            <p>   </p><p>•	feel that they directly contribute to the company's success </p>

        <h2><center>Myers-Briggs 16 Personalities Test</center></h2>
        <p> </p>
        <h3>What do the results of this test mean for you?</h3>
        <p> </p>
        The results of this test mean that I need to be aware of my tendency to be driven by success and to be a perfectionist. 
        When in a team, especially if I was leading the team, I would need to be aware of the needs of others and not impose 
        unrealistic expectations on other team members. As a diplomat, I should be able to negotiate through any conflicts, 
        hopefully without creating losers and winners, and be able to create an atmosphere of harmony and cooperation. I would
        probably work best in smaller groups but if working in a large group would need to be aware of and work towards creating 
        a cooperative and trustful environment where team members are comfortable working together towards a common objective 
        and that the stronger team members are comfortable taking on mentoring roles so that they support the weaker team members. 
        I would hope to have the confidence to encourage creative thinking and solutions.
        <p> </p>
        <h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
        <p> </p>
        <p>In a team environment identifying the characteristics of the other team members is important to be able to support 
            their efforts. Participating in team communication would also be very important to ensure that all team members 
            were working towards the same objectives. Taking the time to check in with other team members to see how they are 
            doing and support their efforts by casually mentoring if they are struggling or just listening to them will help to 
            feel that they are valued. Supporting the team member who is the social group builder is also important as they are 
            the person who will build the goodwill in the team. They are the person who will organise to celebrate successful 
            completion of projects, or just get together for fun and these events help team members to get to know one another 
            and to work together more harmoniously.
        <p> </p> 
        <h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
        <p>When forming a team, I would look for people with the qualities needed to make a successful team. A person who asks 
            questions helps to clarify any ambiguity in the project can head off problems later, someone who is proactive and 
            a finisher often sets the pace for the rest of the team and keeps them on track to finish in good time, a diplomatic 
            person can help to smooth over any conflicts within the team and a person who will initiate social activities to help 
            team members get to know each other, celebrate finished projects and successes and grow the team both professionally 
            and socially.  </p>

        <h2><center>VAK Learning Styles: Visual Learning</center></h2>
        <p> </p>
        <h3>What do the results of this test mean for you?</h3>
        <p> </p>
        These test results have helped to clarify my understanding of my learning style and my preference for many different formats
         of material. It also clarifies that my learning is supported by note-taking. I have always found that this helps to solidify
          the information that I am hearing or seeing. It also means that I will now be more aware of the learning styes of other 
          members of my team and that I need to cater to the other learning styles if I want to be a good communicator.</p>
          <p> </p>
        <h3>>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3
         <p> </p>
        <p>When working in a group I would use this style of learning to present my work as it seems to be a common learning style. Since 
        I prefer handouts to support whatever mode of communication a presenter uses so that I can go back over the information again 
        later, I would make sure that a summary of the information I was imparting to the team would also be printed or sent as an email 
        with links to more information if that was appropriate.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
        <p> </p>
        <p>This information would be useful when forming a team so that any information could be tailored to individual learning styles. 
        For visual learners, having the information presented in visual form with colour-coding, images, written text, and in multi-modal
        formats will support team members understanding and retention of information. For auditory learners, having an oral presentation 
        to support the visual information would help them to retain the information. Kinesthetic learners would be the hardest to cater 
        to in a work team environment. Kinesthetic learners would seem to learn best in an Agile sprint style presentation as they can 
        remain standing and could move about while taking in the relevant information as well as participating in presenting their own 
        information. Understanding learning styles will help to ensure that all team members are supported in their preferred 
        communication and learning styles.</p>

        <h3>What do the results of this test mean for you?</h3>
        <p> </p>
        <p>The result of this test tells me which values I have that will be valuable to the team and will support their success and 
        which ones will isolate me from the team or challenge the teams' ability to reach its full potential. Although it is good 
        to have a mix of personality types in a successful team, it also needs all the members of the team to be working towards 
        the success of the team as well as the success of the projects.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
        <p> </p>
        <p>In a team environment, knowing the results of a test like this is a valuable resource to tell you the qualities you have 
        that will be of value to the team and to let you know which skills you may need to work at improving. Once you are aware 
        of the skills or personality traits that you do not excel in, you can be aware and try to improve on them.</p> 
        <p> </p>
        <h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
        <p> </p>
        <p>When forming a team it would be a good idea to ensure that the team includes a mixture of qualities. To have 
        too many social people on a team and no doers and finishers could make it difficult for the team to finish its'
        projects on time. By the same token, having no social people on the team might mean that the incidence of conflict 
        increases as there has been no effort to creating any empathy or understanding between team members. </p>
