        <h3>Why RMIT?</h3>

       <p>When I began studying, I was working and needed to be able to study during non-working hours. I also still have 
        commitments at home that take a high priority. The most efficient method of studying was and is online. I contacted 
        OUA and talked to them about enrolling in an Information Technology course. RMIT was the best fit and so I began to 
        study with OUA/RMIT. I love learning in the online environment because I can study when the time suits me, I don't 
        need to travel to classes, and I can take my coursework with me wherever I am. The people I study with and those who 
        teach the courses are friendly, engaged in the courses, and interesting to talk to, especially to hear about where 
        they are, what they are doing and why they decided to study or work online with OUA/RMIT.</p>

        <h3>What do I expect to Learn</h3>

        <p><center>Students working with computers</center></p>
    
       <p>During my studies, I expect to learn about computing languages and writing programs, design skills to improve usability
         and presentation, and to facilitate the use of computers by people with visual, physical, and intellectual disabilities. 
         I also expect to learn more about the architecture of different configurations of computers to be used in different ways. 
         I also hope to learn about security as I believe this is very important and methods of working and managing projects.   

        Most of all, I would like to be able to be part of a dedicated team that works to make the world more available to people 
        with disabilities. We have a daughter who has cerebral palsy and several family members who are deaf several who are on 
        the autism spectrum. Over the years advances in technology have made a difference in the fields of education, communication, 
        independence, medicine, and safety for people with disabilities. There are many advances also being made in the field of 
        medicine and rehabilitation where games such as Wii games or VR devices such as Oculus are used to provide Occupational 
        Therapy services that patients of all ages and all abilities are enthusiastic about using.</p>
